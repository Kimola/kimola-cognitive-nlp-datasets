## How The Dataset is Collected & Structured

We have collected multilingual conversations with [Kimola Analytics ](https://kimola.com/analytics)from Twitter and forums. While structuring the data -as we know that there are different consumer behaviors and different feedbacks in every business - we separated the conversations sector by sector such as Banking, Automotive, Telco. Each excel file has 100 rows of consumer feedbacks. We have also cleaned the data to help you get a better analysis and anonymized the proper nouns ad user information to help you work on the data safely.

## Analyzing The Data (Unsupervised & Supervised Analysis)
You can use the datasets on Kimola Cognitive to analyze them without any ML model as it supports **unsupervised learning** and **you can also use the datasets below** to create machine learning models of your own. 

- ### [Pre-Built ML Models to Analyze Data ](https://kimola.com/cognitive/gallery)
Here are some pre-built ML models offered by Kimola Cognitive that can help you classify the consumer feedbacks.
